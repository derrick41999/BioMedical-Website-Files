Our online forms ask for a small amount of relevant information, such as name, company name, email, street address, and phone number.  Some forms may ask for a product serial number.  If you make a purchase or order a repair, we may ask for your credit card number and other billing information.

		<p>CBMI strives to collect, use and disclose Personal Information in a manner consistent with the privacy and data security laws of the countries in which it does business.

		<span id="contactUsENG"></span>

		<p>While this Privacy Statement is intended to describe the broadest range of our information processing activities in those jurisdictions where we do business, those processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws. For example, the laws of a particular country may limit the types of Personal Information we can collect or the manner in which we process that information. In those instances, we adjust our internal policies and practices to reflect the requirements of local law and local laws will prevail over terms in this Privacy Statement. </p>
